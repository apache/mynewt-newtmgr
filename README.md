# Newtmgr

Newt Manager (newtmgr) is the application tool that enables a user to communicate with and manage
remote devices running the Mynewt OS. It uses a connection profile to establish a connection with
a device and sends command requests to the device.
The newtmgr tool documentation can be found under [/docs](/docs) which are
published at http://mynewt.apache.org/latest/os/modules/devmgmt/newtmgr.html

### Building

Build the newtmgr tool as follows:

1. Unpack newtmgr source.
2. Rename resulting `apache-mynewt-newtmgr-1.9.0` directory to `$GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr`
3. `cd $GOPATH/src/mynewt.apache.org/newtmgr/newtmgr`
4. `GO111MODULE=on go build`
